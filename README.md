In the screenshot above you will see me creating a virtual machine where I will click the blue button named "REVIEW + CREATE" on the buttom. By using a Microsoft Azure VM I will be utilizing a dedicated environment to install and configure osTicket without affecting my personal computer.

In the screenshot above you'll see I Installed IIS because without IIS, there‚Äôs no way to access the ticketing system via a web browser.
After enabling IIS, you can open http://localhost/osticket/setup/ and start the installation!
